  - ~~Bind wl_compositor and wl_output globals (you’ll need both to create lock surfaces).~~
  - ~~Call lock_manager.lock(qh, ()) and store the returned ExtSessionLockV1.~~
  - ~~Implement Dispatch<ExtSessionLockV1, ()> to handle locked/finished.~~
  - ~~For each output, create a wl_surface and call lock.get_lock_surface(...).~~
  - ~~Handle ExtSessionLockSurfaceV1::configure before the first commit.~~
  - Render a solid color buffer to each lock surface and auto-unlock after 5 seconds as a safety check.

  - Ratatui integration: build UI state + layout using a non-terminal backend (e.g. TestBackend) and render to a 2D cell buffer.
  - Ratatui integration: add a renderer that converts the cell buffer into pixels for a wl_shm buffer, then attach/commit to the lock surface.
