  - ~~Bind wl_compositor and wl_output globals (you’ll need both to create lock surfaces).~~
  - ~~Call lock_manager.lock(qh, ()) and store the returned ExtSessionLockV1.~~
  - ~~Implement Dispatch<ExtSessionLockV1, ()> to handle locked/finished.~~
  - ~~For each output, create a wl_surface and call lock.get_lock_surface(...).~~
  - ~~Handle ExtSessionLockSurfaceV1::configure before the first commit.~~
  - ~~Render a solid color buffer to each lock surface and auto-unlock after 5 seconds as a safety check.~~
  - ~~Wire wl_buffer::Release to mark buffers reusable and re-render when dirty.~~
  - ~~Add actual pixel fill into shm buffer (solid color) before committing.~~
  - ~~Use shared shm mapping and double buffering so compositors can release buffers.~~
  - Ratatui integration: build UI state + layout using a non-terminal backend (e.g. TestBackend) and render to a 2D cell buffer.
  - Ratatui integration: add a renderer that converts the cell buffer into pixels for a wl_shm buffer, then attach/commit to the lock surface.
  - Ratatui integration design:
    - src/tui/mod.rs: AppState, input handling, and view(frame, state) rendering.
    - src/render/mod.rs: rasterizer that maps ratatui Buffer cells to ARGB pixels (optional background animation blend).
    - src/main.rs: Wayland loop that drives input/ticks, calls tui render, rasterizes, and commits shm buffers.
    - Minimal API: tui::render(state, width_cells, height_cells) -> ratatui::buffer::Buffer.
    - Minimal API: render::rasterize(buffer, target_bytes, width_px, height_px, time_or_tick).
    - Testing: use ratatui TestBackend in tui tests to assert cell output without Wayland.
  - ~~TUI preview + login UI:~~
    - ~~Added `src/bin/tui.rs` preview runner (Crossterm + Ratatui).~~
    - ~~Centered login box with username/password fields and cursor placement.~~
    - ~~Input handling for focus (Tab/Up/Down), editing, and Enter submit routing via `AppAction::Submit`.~~
